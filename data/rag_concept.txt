Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique where a language model retrieves external information before generating an answer.
RAG improves factual accuracy and allows models to answer questions outside their training data.
The pipeline usually includes:
1. Chunking documents
2. Creating embeddings
3. Storing in a vector database
4. Retrieving top results
5. Reranking and generating a final answer
