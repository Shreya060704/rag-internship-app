Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
AI systems can perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and language understanding.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where systems learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
Deep Learning, a type of ML, uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data.
