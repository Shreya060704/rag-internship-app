Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey

Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to improve factual accuracy. By integrating retrieval and generation, RAG reduces hallucinations and enables dynamic knowledge grounding.

1. Introduction
Traditional language models rely solely on pretraining data, which becomes outdated quickly. RAG addresses this by connecting the model to a live knowledge base, such as a vector database.

2. Core Components

Chunking: Breaking long documents into smaller passages for indexing.

Embeddings: Mapping text into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning.

Vector Database: Specialized databases like Pinecone that store and retrieve embeddings efficiently.

Reranking: Models such as Cohereâ€™s reranker reorder retrieved results for better relevance.

Generation: A language model, e.g., BART or GPT, generates a final answer conditioned on retrieved context.

3. Applications
RAG has shown strong results in:

Open-domain question answering

Enterprise document search

Chatbots with up-to-date knowledge

Research assistants

4. Challenges

Efficient chunking for large corpora

Handling noisy retrieval results

Balancing latency with accuracy

Integrating multimodal data (e.g., text + images)

5. Conclusion
RAG provides a powerful framework for combining retrieval and generation, enhancing both factual accuracy and adaptability. Future work should focus on evaluation benchmarks and real-world deployments.
