Cohere provides language models for text generation, embeddings, and reranking.
The reranker model takes a query and a set of documents, then reorders them by relevance.
This improves search quality by pushing the most useful results higher.
Cohere's reranker is commonly used alongside vector search systems like Pinecone.
